# clean-sublime-text-project-history
deletes references to non existing project files from the sublime_session file

session_file_path has to be changed in order to work on windows though

**exit SublimeText before running this script!**

If you're not familiar with node: you'll need to install [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/). Install dependancies by running "npm install" from the command prompt in the folder containing these files. Then type "node cleanSublimeTextProjectHistory.js".
