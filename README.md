# clean-sublime-text-project-history
deletes references to non existing project files from the sublime_session file

tested in osx and win7. for other OS we still need the session_file_path so please fork this

**exit SublimeText before running this script!**

if you're not familiar with node: you'll need to install [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/). install dependancies by running "npm install" from the command prompt in the folder containing these files. then type "node cleanSublimeTextProjectHistory.js".
